## Goal

The goal of the project, "E-Commerce Website," is to create a fully functional e-commerce website that enables users to browse, search for, select, and purchase products online. This website aims to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience, including user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart functionality, payment processing, and order management. The project's objective is to demonstrate proficiency in developing a modern e-commerce platform using the MERN stack, enhance user experience, and facilitate successful online transactions.

## What I Learnt

I built an e-commerce website all on my own to improve my skills with the MERN stack. I started by planning what the site would do and sketching how it should look. Then, I used Node.js and Express for the server part and React for the part you see in your browser. To store all the data, I used MongoDB, which was easy to work with thanks to Mongoose. After creating everything, I tested it to make sure it worked well. When I was sure it did, I put it on the internet so anyone could use it. I paid extra attention to making it safe and fast. I also made guides to help people use it, and even after it was done, I kept making it better to meet new needs. This project really helped me get better with the MERN stack.

Thanks to [Brad](https://github.com/bradtraversy) for providing this wonderful course, which helped me gain a solid understanding of the concepts and how the development process works.
